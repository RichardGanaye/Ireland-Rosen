\paragraph{Ex. 7.1}

{\it Use the method of Theorem 1 to show that a finite subgroup of the
multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.
}

\bigskip

A solution is already given in Ex. 4.15

\paragraph{Ex. 7.2}

{\it Find the finite subgroups of $\R^*$ and $\C^*$ and show directly that they are cyclic.
}

\begin{proof}
If $G$ is a finite subgroup of $\R$ or $\C$, and $n = \vert G \vert$, then from Lagrange's Theorem, $x^n = 1$ for all $x \in G$.

$\bullet$ If  $G$ is a finite subgroup of $\R^*$, then the solutions of $x^n=1$ are in $\{-1,1\}$, so $\{1\} \subset G\subset \{-1,1\}$ : 
$G = \{1\}$ or $G = \{-1,1\}$, both cyclic.

$\bullet$ If  $G$ is a finite subgroup of $\C^*$, then $G \subset \mathbb{U}_n = \{e^{2ik\pi/n}\ \vert \ 0 \leq k \leq n-1\}$. As $\vert G \vert = \vert \mathbb{U}_n \vert = n$, then  $G = \mathbb{U}_n \simeq \Z/n\Z$ is cyclic.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.3}

{\it  Let $F$ a field with $q$ elements and suppose that $q\equiv 1 \pmod n$. Show that for $\alpha \in \F^*$, the equation $x^n = \alpha$ has either no solutions or $n$ solutions.
}

\begin{proof} This is a particular case of Prop. 7.1.2., where $d = n \wedge (q-1) = n$ : the equation $x^n =\alpha$ has solutions iff $\alpha^{(q-1)/n} = 1$. In this case, there are exactly $d = n$ solutions.

We give  here a direct proof.

Let $g$ a generator of $F^*$.  Write $x = g^y, \alpha = g^a$. Then
$$x^n = \alpha \iff g^{ny} = g^a\iff q-1 \mid ny -a.$$

Suppose that there exists $x\in F$ such that $x^n = \alpha$. Then there exists $y\in \Z$ such that $q-1 \mid ny -a$. Since $n \mid q-1$, then  $n \mid a$.
$$q-1 \mid ny -a \iff \frac{q-1}{n} \mid y - \frac{a}{n}\iff y= \frac{a}{n} + k \frac{q-1}{n}, k\in \mathbb{Z}.$$

As  $\frac{a}{n} + (k+n) \frac{q-1}{n} = \frac{a}{n} + k \frac{q-1}{n}, k\in \mathbb{Z}$, the values $k=0,1\cdots,n-1 $ are sufficient :
$$x^n=\alpha \iff y = \frac{a}{n} + k \frac{q-1}{n}, k\in \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}.$$

Moreover, these solutions are all distinct : if $k,l\in  \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}$,
\begin{align*}
g^{\frac{a}{n} + k \frac{q-1}{n}} = g^{\frac{a}{n} + l \frac{q-1}{n}} & \Rightarrow g^{(k-l) \frac{q-1}{n}} = 1\\
&\Rightarrow q-1 \mid (k-l) \frac{q-1}{n}\\
& \Rightarrow n \mid k-l \\
&\Rightarrow k\equiv l \ [n] \Rightarrow k=l.
\end{align*}

Conclusion : if  $F$ is a field with $q$ elements and $n \mid q-1$, the equation $x^n = \alpha$ has either no solutions or $n$ solutions in $F$.

Remark : $$\exists x \in F^*, x^n = \alpha \iff n \mid a \iff \alpha^{(q-1)/n} = 1.$$

Indeed, if $x^n = \alpha$ has a solution, we have proved that $n\mid a$, thus $\alpha^{(q-1)/n} = (g^{a/n})^{q-1} = 1$.

Reciprocally, if $\alpha^{(q-1)/n} = 1$, $g^{a.(q-1)/ n }=1$, thus $q-1 \mid a(q-1)/n$, so $ n \mid a$ :  $\alpha = x^n$, with $x = g^{n/a}$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.4}

{\it (continuation) Show that the set of $\alpha \in F^*$ such that $x^n = \alpha$ is solvable is a subgroup with $(q-1)/n$ elements.
}

\begin{proof}
Here $n \mid q-1$.

Let $\varphi = F^* \to F^*$ the application defined by $\varphi(x) = x^n$. $\varphi$ is a morphism of groups, and $\ker \varphi$ is the set of solutions of $x^n = 1$.
As $n \mid q-1$, $x^n = 1$ has exactly $n$ solutions (Prop 7.1.1, Corollary2, or Ex 7.3 with $\alpha = 1$). So $\vert \ker \varphi \vert = n$.

Thus $\mathrm{Im} \varphi \simeq F^*/\ker \varphi$ is a subgroup with cardinality $\vert F^* \vert / \vert \ker \varphi \vert = (q-1)/n$, and $\mathrm{Im} \varphi$ is the set of $\alpha$ such that $x^n = \alpha$ is solvable.

Conclusion : the set of $\alpha \in F^*$ such that $x^n = \alpha$ is solvable is a subgroup with $(q-1)/n$ elements.

\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.5}

{\it (continuation) Let $K$ be a field containing $F$ such that $[K:F] = n$. For all $\alpha \in F^*$, show that the equation $x^n = \alpha$ has $n$ solutions in $K$. [Hint: Show that $q^n-1$ is divisible by $n(q-1)$ and use the fact that $\alpha^{q-1} = 1$.]

}

\begin{proof}
As $q\equiv 1 \ [n], \frac{q^n-1}{q-1} = 1+q+\cdots+q^{n-1} \equiv 0 \ [n]$, then $n \mid \frac{q^n-1}{q-1} : $
$$q^n-1 = k n (q-1), k \in \mathbb{N}.$$

Since $\alpha \in F^*$, $\alpha^{q-1} = 1$, so $$\alpha^{(q^n-1)/n} = (\alpha^{q-1})^k = 1.$$

As $\vert K \vert = q^n$, Prop. 7.1.2 (or the final remark in Ex.7.3) show that there exists $x \in K^*$ such that $x^n = \alpha$. Then, from Ex.7.3, we know that there exist $n$ solutions in $K$.

Conclusion : if $[K:F] = n$, the equation $x^n = \alpha$ has $n$ solutions in $K$.

\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.6}

{\it Let $K \supset F$ be finite fields with $[K:F] = 3$. Show that if $\alpha \in F$ is not a square in $F$, it is not a square in $K$.

}

\begin{proof}
Let $q = \vert F \vert$. Then $\vert K \vert = q^3.$

If the characteristic of $F$ is 2, $q = 2^k$, and for all $x \in F$, $x = x^q = \left (x^{2^{k-1}}\right)^2$. So all elements in $F$ or $K$ are squares.
We can now suppose that the characteristic of $F$ is not 2, and consequently $1 \neq -1$ in $F$.

As $\alpha$ is not a square in $F$, $\alpha^{(q-1)/2} \ne 1$ (Prop. 7.1.2). From  $0 = \alpha^{q-1} - 1 = (\alpha^{(q-1)/2}-1)(\alpha^{(q-1)/2}+1)$, we deduce $\alpha^{(q-1)/2} = -1$. Then 
$$\alpha^{(q^3-1)/2} = (\alpha^{(q-1)/2})^{q^2+q+1} = (-1)^{q^2+q+1} = -1,$$
since $q^2+q+1$ is always odd.

$\alpha^{(q^3-1)/2} \neq 1$ : this implies (Prop. 7.1.2) that $\alpha$ is not a square in $K$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.7}

{\it  Generalize Exercise 6 by showing that if $\alpha$ is not a square in $F$, it is not a square in any extension of odd degree and is a square in every extension of even degree.

}

\begin{proof}
Write $q = [K:F]$, and $q = \mathrm{Card}\ F$.

As $\alpha$ is not a square in $F$, the characteristic of $F$ is not 2 (see Ex.7.6), and $\alpha^{(q-1)/2} \ne 1$. Since $\alpha^{q-1} = 1$, $\alpha^{(q-1)/2}= -1$.
$$\alpha^{(q^n-1)/2} =( \alpha^{(q-1)/2})^{1+q+\cdots+q^{n-1}} = (-1)^{1+q+\cdots+q^{n-1}} .$$

$\bullet$ If $n$ is odd, $1 + q +\cdots+q^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod 2$, thus $\alpha^{(q^n-1)/2} = -1\ne 1$, and consequently $\alpha$ is not a square in $K$.

$\bullet$ If $n$ is even, as $q$ is odd ($\mathrm{char}(F) \ne 2$), $1 + q +\cdots+q^{n-1} \equiv 0 \pmod 2$, thus $\alpha^{(q^n-1)/2} = 1$, so $\alpha$ is a square in $K$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.8}

{\it  In a field with $2^n$ elements, what is the subgroup of squares.
}

\bigskip

Let $F$ a field with $q = 2^n$ elements. 

\bigskip

{\bf Proof 1}
\begin{proof}
$d = (q-1) \wedge 2 = (2^n - 1) \wedge 2 = 1$, thus each $\alpha \in F^*$ verifies $\alpha^{(q-1)/d} = \alpha^{q-1} = 1$. Theorem 7.1.2 show that $\alpha$ is a square in $F$, of exactly one root.
\end{proof}

{\bf Proof 2}
\begin{proof}
For all $x \in F$, $x = x^q = \left (x^{2^{n-1}}\right)^2$. So all elements in $F$ or $K$ are squares.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.9}

{\it If $K \supset F$ are finite fields, $\vert F \vert = q, \alpha \in F, q\equiv 1 \pmod n$, and $x^n = \alpha$ is not solvable in $F$, show that $x^n = \alpha$ is not solvable in $K$ if $(n,[K:F]) = 1$.
}

\begin{proof}
Let $k = [K:F]$. From hypothesis, $k\wedge n = 1$, so there exist integers $u,v$ such that $uk+vn = 1$.

As $n \mid q-1$, $n \wedge (q-1) = n$, so the hypothesis "$x^n = \alpha$ is not solvable in $F$" implies that $\alpha^{(q-1)/n} \neq 1$ (Prop. 7.1.2).

Write $\omega =\alpha^{(q-1)/n}$, so $\omega \ne 1$ and $\omega^n = 1$.

As $n \mid q-1$, $n \mid q^k - 1$ and
$$\alpha^{(q^k-1)/n} = (\alpha^{(q-1)/n})^{1+q+q^2+\cdots+q^{k-1}} =  \omega^{1+q+q^2+\cdots+q^{k-1}}.$$
Moreover $1+q+\cdots+q^{k-1} \equiv k \pmod n$, and $\omega^n = 1$, so $\alpha^{(q^k-1)/n} = \omega^k$.

If $\omega^k = 1$, then $\omega = \omega^{uk+vn} = (\omega^k)^u (\omega^n)^v = 1$, which is in contradiction with $\omega = \alpha^{(q-1)/n} \ne 1$.

So $\alpha^{(q^k-1)/n} = \omega^k \ne 1$, and consequently the equation $x^n = \alpha$ has no solution in $K$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.10}

{\it If $K \supset F$ be finite fields and $[K:F] = 2$. For $\beta \in K$, show that $\beta^{1+q} \in F$ and moreover that every element in $F$ is of the form $\beta^{1+q}$ for some $\beta \in K$.
}

\begin{proof}
If $\beta = 0$, $\beta^{1+q} = 0 \in F$, and if $\beta \in K^*$, $\beta^{q^2-1} = 1$, so $\left(\beta ^{1+q}\right)^{q-1} = 1$, thus $ \beta^{1+q} \in F$ (Prop. 7.1.1, Corollary 1).

Let  $g$ a generator of $K^*$ : $K^* = \{1,g,g^2,\cdots,g^{q^2-2}\}$.

For every in integer $k \in \Z$, 
$$g^k  \in F^* \iff (g^k)^{q-1} = 1 \iff g^{k(q-1)}=1 \iff q^2-1 \mid k(q-1) \iff q+1 \mid k.$$
Thus $F^* = \{1,g^{q+1}, g^{2(q+1)},\cdots, g^{(q-2)(q+1)}\}$. I $\alpha \in F^*$, there exists $i, 0 \leq i \leq q-1$ such that $\alpha = g^{i(q+1)}$.
If we write $\beta = g^i$, then $\alpha = \beta^{1+q}$ (and for $\alpha = 0$, we take $\beta = 0$).

Conclusion : if $K$ is a quadratic extension of $F$ ($F,K$ finite fields), every element in $F$ is of the form $\beta^{1+q}$ for some $\beta \in K$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.11}

{\it With the situation being that of Exercise 10 suppose that $\alpha \in F$ has order $q-1$. Show that there is a $\beta \in K$ with order $q^2-1$ such that $\beta^{1+q} = \alpha$.
}

\bigskip

Write $|a|$ the order of an element $a$ in a group $G$. We recall the following lemma :

\bigskip

{\bf Lemma} If $|a| = d$, then for all $i \in \Z$, $| a^i | = \frac{d}{d\wedge i}$.
\begin{proof}
Indeed, for all $k \in \Z$,
$$(a^i)^k=e \iff a^{ik}=e \iff d \mid ik \iff \frac{d}{d \wedge i} \mid \frac{i}{d \wedge i}\,k \iff \frac{d}{d \wedge i} \mid k.$$
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}(Ex. 7.11)

Let $\alpha \in F^*$ with $|a| = q-1$, and $g$ a generator of $K^*$, so $|g| = q^2-1$. We know from exercise 7.10 that there exists an integer i such that $\alpha = g^{i(q+1)}$.

Let $h = g^{q+1}$. As $h^{q-1} = 1$, then $h \in F^*$, and since $|g| = q^2-1$, $|h| = q-1$, so $h$ is a generator of $F^*$.

Note that for all $s\in \Z$, $\alpha = g^{(i+s(q-1))(q+1)}$, since $g^{q^2-1} = 1$.

We will show that we can choose $s$ such that $j = i +s(q-1)$ is relatively prime with $q+1$. Then  $j$ is such that $\alpha = g^{j(q+1)} = h^j$.


$i$ is odd : if not $\alpha$ is an element of the subgroup of squares in $F^*$, so its order divides $(q-1)/2$, in contradiction with $|\alpha| = q-1$.

 $(q-1)\wedge (q+1) \mid 2$. Since $i-1$ is even, there exist integers $s,t$ verifying the BŽzout's equation
$$i-1 = t(q+1)-s(q-1).$$
Then $j = i+s(q-1) = 1 + t(q+1)$ is relatively prime with $q+1$ : $j \wedge (q+1) = 1$.

Moreover, as $\alpha = h^j$, with $|\alpha| = |h| = q-1$, the lemme implies that
$$q-1 = |\alpha| = \frac{q-1}{(q-1)\wedge j},$$
so $(q-1) \wedge j = 1$.
As $(q+1) \wedge j = 1$ and $(q-1) \wedge j = 1$, then $(q^2-1) \wedge j = 1$.

Let $\beta = g^j$ : then $\alpha = \beta^{1+q}$, and using the lemma :
$$|\beta| = |g^j| = \frac{q^2-1}{(q^2-1)\wedge j} = q^2-1.$$
Conclusion :  there exists a $\beta \in K^*$ with order $q^2-1$ such that $\beta^{1+q} = \alpha$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.12}

{\it Use Proposition 7.2.1 to show that given a field $k$ and a polynomial $f(x) \in k[x]$ there is a field $K\supset k$ such that $[K:k]$ is finite and $f(x) = a(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_n)$ in $K[x]$.
}

\begin{proof}
We show by induction on the degree $n$ of $f$ that for all polynomials $f \in k[x]$ with $\deg(f) = n \geq 1$, there exists a field extension $K$ such that $[K:k]$ is finite, and $f(x)$ splits in linear factors on $K$.

If $n = 1$, $f(x) = ax+b = a(x-\alpha_0)$, where $\alpha_0 = -b/a$ : $K = k$ is suitable.

Suppose that the property is true for all polynomials of degree less than $n$ on an arbitrary field $k$.

Let $f(x) \in k[x], \deg(f) = n$. From propoistion 7.2.1. applied to an irreducible factor of $f$, there exists a field $L, [L:K]<\infty$ and $\alpha \in L$ such that $f(\alpha_1) = 0$. Then $f(x) = (x-\alpha_1) g(x), g(x) \in L[x]$. 

Applying the induction hypothesis in the field $L$ on the polynomial $g \in L[x]$ with $\deg(g) = n-1$, we obtain a field $K, [K:L]<\infty$ such that $g(x) = a(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_n)$ with $\alpha_i \in K$. So  $f(x) = a(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_n)$ splits in linear factors in $K$. The induction is achieved.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.13}

{\it Apply Exercise 7.12 to $k = \Z/p\Z$ and $f(x) = x^{p^n} -x$ to obtain another proof of Theorem 2.
}

\begin{proof}
Let $f(x) =  x^{p^n} -x$. We know from Ex. 7.12 that there exists a finite extension $K$ of $\F_p$ such that $f$ splits in linear factors on $K$ :
$$f(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{p^n} (x-\alpha_k), \qquad \alpha_1,\ldots, \alpha_{p^n} \in K.$$
The set $k =\{\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_{p_n}\} \subset K$ of the roots of $x^{p^n} -x$ is a subfield of $K$ : indeed, if $\alpha, \beta \in k$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $f(1) = 0$, so $1 \in k$
\item[(b)]$(\alpha- \beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} - \beta^{p^n} = \alpha - \beta$, so $\alpha - \beta \in k$.
\item[(c)] $(\alpha\beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} \beta^{p^n} = \alpha  \beta$, so $\alpha \beta \in k$.
\item[(d)] $(\alpha^{-1})^{p^n} = (\alpha^{p^n})^{-1} = \alpha^{-1}$, so $\alpha^{-1} \in k$ if $\alpha \ne 0$.
\end{enumerate}
As $f'(x) = -1$, $f(x) \wedge f'(x) = 1$, so $f$ has no multiple root, so the cardinality of $k$ is $p^n$.

Let $g(x) \in \F_p[x]$ a factor of $f(x)$, irreducible in $\F_p[x]$, with $d =\deg(g)$. As $g \mid f$, $g$ splits in linear factors in $k[x]$. Let $\alpha$ a root of $g(x)$ in $k$. As $g$ is irreducible on $\F_p$, 
$d = \deg(g) = [\F_p[\alpha] : \F_p]$. Moreover $ n = [k : \F_p] = [k : \F_p[\alpha]]\,[\F_p[\alpha] : \F_p]$, so $d \mid n$.

Reciprocally, suppose that $g$ is any irreducible polynomial in $\F_p[x]$, with $d = \deg(g) \mid n$. Then $K_0 = \F_p[x]/ \langle g\rangle$  contains a root $\alpha$ of $g$, and $[K_0:\F_p] = \deg(g) = d$, so $\alpha^{p^d} = \alpha$.

As $d\mid n$ , then $p^d-1 \mid p^n-1$ and $x^{p^d}-1 \mid x^{p^n}-1$ (Lemma 2,3 in section 1), so
$$x^{p^d} - x \mid x^{p^n}-x.$$
$f(\alpha) = \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0$ and $g$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$, so $g \mid f$.

Conclusion : 
$$ x^{p^n}-x = \prod_{d\mid n} F_d(x),$$
where $F_d(x)$ is the product of the monic irreducible polynomial of degree $d$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.14}

{\it  Let $F$ be a field with $q$ elements and $n$ a positive integer. Show that there exist irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ of degree $n$.
}

\begin{proof}
Leq $F = \F_q$ a field with $q = p^m$ elements, and $n$ a positive integer.

From Theorem 2 Corollary 3, there exists an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \F_p[x]$ of degree $nm$. Let $g$ an irreducible factor of $f$ in $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, and $\alpha$ a root of $g$ in an extension of $\F_q$.

\bigskip

We show that $\F_q \subset \F_p[\alpha]$.

$\F_q$ and $\F_p[\alpha]$ are two subfield of the same finite field $\F_q[\alpha]$. Moreover, $|\F_q| = p^m$, and $|\F_p[\alpha]| = p^{nm} $. As $m\mid n$, $\F_q \subset \F_p[\alpha]$ .

Indeed, for all  $\gamma \in \F_q[\alpha]$,$$ \gamma \in \F_q \Rightarrow  \gamma^{p^m} =  \gamma \Rightarrow  \gamma^{p^{mn}} =  \gamma \Rightarrow  \gamma \in \F_p[\alpha].$$
So $\F_q \subset \F_p[\alpha]$.

\bigskip

We show that $\F_q[\alpha] =  \F_p[\alpha]$.

As $\F_p \subset \F_q$, $\F_p[\alpha] \subset \F_q[\alpha]$.

Let $\beta \in \F_q[\alpha]$ : $\beta = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k a_i\alpha^i$, where $a_i \in \F[q] \subset \F_p[\alpha]$, so $a_i = p_i(\alpha), p_i \in \F_p[\alpha]$. Consequently
$$\beta = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k p_i(\alpha) \alpha^i \in \F_p[\alpha],$$
so $\F_q[\alpha] =  \F_p[\alpha]$.

$$nm = [\mathbb{F}_p[\alpha] : \mathbb{F}_p] = [\mathbb{F}_q[\alpha]:\mathbb{F}_p] = [\mathbb{F}_q[\alpha] : \mathbb{F}_q]\times [\mathbb{F}_q:\mathbb{F}_p] =  [\mathbb{F}_q[\alpha] : \mathbb{F}_q]\times m .$$
Thus  $[\mathbb{F}_q[\alpha] : \mathbb{F}_q] = n$, and $g$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ on $\F_q$, so $\deg(g) = n$.

Conclusion : if $F$ is a field with $q = p^m$ elements, there exist irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ of degree $n$ for all positive integers $n$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 7.15}

{\it Let $x^n-1 \in F[x]$, where $F$ is a finite field with $q$ elements. Suppose that $(q,n) = 1$. Show that $x^n-1$ splits into linear factors in some extension field and that the least degree of such a field is the smallest integer $f$ such that $q^f \equiv 1 \pmod n$.

}

\begin{proof}
From exercise 7.12, we know that $x^n-1$ splits into linear factors in some extension field $K$, with $[K:F]<\infty$ :
$$u(x)= x^n-1 = (x-\zeta_0)(x-\zeta_1)\cdots(x-\zeta_{n-1}), \qquad \zeta_i \in K.$$
$u'(x)\wedge u(x) = nx^{n-1} \wedge (x^n-1) = 1$, since $x(nx^{n-1}) - n(x^n-1) = n$, and $n\neq 0$ in the field $F$, since we know from the hypothesis $q \wedge n=1$ that the characteristic $p$ doesn't divide $n$. So the $n$ roots of $x^n-1$ are distinct.

The set $G = \{x \in K \ \vert \ x^n=1\}$ is a subgroup of $K^*$, thus $G$ is cyclic of order $n$. Let $\zeta$ a generator of $G$. Then
$$x^n-1 = (x-1)(x-\zeta)(x-\zeta^2)\cdots(x-\zeta^{n-1}).$$

Let $p(x)$ the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ on $F$, and $f$ the degree of $p$ :
$$f = \deg(p) = [F[\zeta] : F].$$
So $\mathrm{Card}\, F[\zeta] = q^f$, and since $\zeta \in F[\zeta]^*$, $\zeta^{q^f - 1} -1 = 0$.
As the order of $\zeta$ in the group $G$ is $n$, $n \mid q^f - 1$, namely $q^f \equiv 1 \pmod n$.

\bigskip

Let $k$ any positive integer such that $q^k \equiv 1 \pmod n$.

Then $n \mid q^k - 1$, so $\zeta^{q^k-1} - 1 = 0$, $\zeta^{q^k} - \zeta = 0$. Let $L$ an extension of $K$ such that $x^{q^k} - x$ splits in linear factors in $L$. As $\zeta^{q^k} - \zeta = 0$, $\zeta $ belongs to the subfield $M$ of $L$ with cardinality $q^k$, such that $[M:F]= k$. Thus $\F[\zeta] \subset M$, so $f = [F[\zeta] : F] \leq k = [M:F]$.

$f = [F[\zeta] : F]$ is the smallest $k \in \N^*$ such that $q^k\equiv 1 \pmod n$.

If $K$ is any extension of $F$ containing the roots of $x^n-1$, then $K \supset F[\zeta]$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive root of unity, so $[K : F] \geq [F[\zeta]:F] = f$.

Conclusion : the minimal degree of a extension $K \supset F$ containing the roots of $x^n - 1$, with $n\wedge q = 1$, is the smallest positive integer $f$ such that $q^f \equiv 1 \pmod n$, the order of $q$ modulo $n$.
\end{proof}
